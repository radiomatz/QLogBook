## requirements:

- Qt6 (best manual install)

## build it:
        mkdir build
        cd build
        /opt/Qt/6.7.2/gcc_64/bin/qmake6 ../QLogBook.pro

or maybe

        qmake6 ../QLogBook.pro

### You MUST ALTER YOUR MAKEFILE NOW by Hand, otherwise it will crash!

Yes, i know, this sounds strange, but this is sadley to say true!<br />
In Your Makefile, at the top, there are two Lines, with CXXFLAGS and CFLAGS<br />
Change the PHRASE "-O2" to "-g" - thats all you need.<br />
  (i can not debug it, since the error is not existing in an built-for-debugging binary, so the optimization is the error)<br />

After that do a:<br />


        make
